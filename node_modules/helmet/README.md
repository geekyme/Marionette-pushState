Express / Connect middleware that implement various security headers. [with sane defaults where applicable]

## Included Middleware

  - csp (Content Security Policy)
  - HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security)
  - xframe (X-FRAME-OPTIONS)
  - iexss (X-XSS-PROTECTION for IE8+)
  - contentTypeOptions (X-Content-Type-Options nosniff)
  - cacheControl (Cache-Control no-store, no-cache)

## Installation

```
npm install helmet
```

## Basic Express Usage

```javascript
    var helmet = require('helmet');
```

To use a particular middleware application wide just add it to your app configuration. Make sure it is listed before app.router.

```javascript
    app.configure(function(){
        app.use(express.methodOverride());
        app.use(express.bodyParser());
        app.use(helmet.csp());
        app.use(helmet.xframe());
        app.use(helmet.contentTypeOptions());
        app.use(app.router);
    });
```

## Content Security Policy
[Content Security Policy (W3C Draft)](https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/content-security-policy/raw-file/tip/csp-specification.dev.html#content-security-policy-header-field)
<- Pretty much required reading if you want to do anything with CSP

### Browser Support
Currently there is CSP support in Firefox and experimental support in Chrome. Both X-Content-Security-Policy and X-WebKit-CSP
headers are set by helmet.


There are two different ways to build CSP policies with helmet.

### Using policy()

policy() eats a json blob (including the output of it's own toJSON() function) to create a policy. By default
helmet has a defaultPolicy that looks like;

```
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'
```

To override this and create a new policy you could do something like

```javascript
policy = {
  defaultPolicy: {
    'default-src': ["'self'"],
    'img-src': ['static.andyet.net','*.cdn.example.com'],
  }
}

helmet.csp.policy(policy);
```

### Using add()

The same thing could be accomplished using add() since the defaultPolicy default-src is already 'self'

```javascript
helmet.csp.add('img-src', ['static.andyet.net', '*.cdn.example.com']);
```

### Reporting Violations

CSP can report violations back to a specified URL. You can either set the report-uri using policy() or add() or
use the reportTo() helper function.

```javascript
helmet.csp.reportTo('http://example.com/csp');
```

## HTTP Strict Transport Security
[draft-ietf-websec-strict-transport-sec-04](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-websec-strict-transport-sec-04)

This middleware adds the Strict-Transport-Security header to the response 

### Basic Usage

To use the default header of Strict-Transport-Security: maxAge=15768000

```javascript
helmet.hsts();
```

To adjust other values for maxAge and to include subdomains

```javascript
helmet.hsts(1234567, true);  // hsts(maxAge, includeSubdomains)
```


## X-FRAME-OPTIONS

xFrame is a lot more straight forward than CSP. It has three modes. DENY, SAMEORIGIN, ALLOW-FROM. If your app does
not need to be framed (and most don't) you can use the default DENY.

### Browser Support
  - IE8+
  - Opera 10.50+
  - Safari 4+
  - Chrome 4.1.249.1042+
  - Firefox 3.6.9 (or earlier with NoScript)

Here is an example for both SAMEORIGIN and ALLOW-FROM

```javascript
helmet.xframe('sameorigin');
```

```javascript
helmet.xframe('allow-from', 'http://example.com');
```

## X-XSS-PROTECTION

The following example sets the X-XSS-PROTECTION: 1; mode=block header

```javascript
helmet.iexss();
```

## X-Content-Type-Options

The following example sets the X-Content-Type-Options header to it's only and default option 'nosniff'

```javascript
helmet.contentTypeOptions();
```

## Cache-Control

The following example sets the Cache-Control header to no-store, no-cache. This is not configurable at this time.

```javascript
helmet.cacheControl();
```

## To Be Implemented

  - Warn when self, unsafe-inline or unsafe-eval are not single quoted
  - Warn when unsafe-inline or unsafe-eval are used
  - Caching of generated CSP headers
  - Device to capture and parse reported CSP violations
